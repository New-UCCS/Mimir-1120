# Assignment Description

Lecture: Pointers 4: Walking an Array with Pointers

Objective: Practice using pointers to walk arrays

### Getting Started

Create a new C project named whatever you want in Visual Studio using the Windows Desktop Wizard or in Xcode.

If you're using Visual Studio, add a main.c file to your project; you can use the main.c template I provided on Canvas if you’d like. If you’re using Xcode, Xcode automatically generates a main.c file for you.

#### Helpful Hints

When you’re using pointers to “walk the array”, be sure you use one of the non-destructive techniques I showed you. Otherwise, you won’t be able to access the array for later processing!

Be sure to free memory and NULL pointers that point to that memory when you’re done with it.

### Requirements

#### Problem 1 - Keep track of max input value

Get the number of elements the user wants in an array; don't prompt for the user input because that will confuse the automated grader..

Allocate memory for an array of the appropriate size. Using pointers to “walk the array”, set the value of each element of the array to its index. In other words, element 0 should be set to 0, element 1 should be set to 1, and so on.

Use the debugger to confirm that your array elements have been set properly.

#### Problem 2 - Printing the Array

Using pointers to “walk the array”, print out the value of each element in the array.

#### Problem 3 - Processing the Array

Using pointers to “walk the array”, calculate the sum of the elements in the array and print the sum. Gauss came up with a very elegant solution that you could modify to use here, but walk the array instead!

### Required Output Format

The image below shows my output when I enter 5; make sure you get the exact same output when you provide the same input.

### Submitting Your Solution
- Click on the gray box below that says Load Graded Exercise 14: Walking the Walk in a new window. **(only in Canvas)**
- Click on the link for this graded assignment from the list of Live Coursework and click the green Submit button under Actions on the left on the assignment page. Upload your main.c file by clicking the Choose File button and navigating to it or by dragging that file onto the upload box. Click the green Submit button on the bottom right of the dialog box.
- Once the test case(s) for the assignment have been run (which typically happens pretty quickly), you can check your results for each test case and your overall score at the top right of the Test Cases section. If you’re happy with your results, you’re done.

If you need (or want) to improve your score, you can look at the test case results, modify your code as appropriate, and resubmit again. If you click on a specific test case, you can get additional information about the output generated by your submission, the expected output for a correct submission, and the difference between the two outputs (in the Pretty Diff section at the bottom of the dialog box).

*All assignments in the course are set for unlimited submissions, so you can resubmit as many times as you want until the due date/time. The grade you’ll receive for the assignment will be the highest grade you achieved across all your submissions for the assignment.*
