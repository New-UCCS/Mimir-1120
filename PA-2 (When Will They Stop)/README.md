# Assignment Description

You want to develop a program that takes in as many positive integers (including 0) as the user wants to enter and then tells them how many integers they entered and the mean (average) of those numbers. This will also give you more practice implementing while loops!

In this assignment, you'll get integer numbers until you get a -1, at which point you’ll print how many numbers you processed (not including the -1) and the mean of those numbers (not including the -1).

### Requirements

Your application must do the following:

- Read in an integer from the user; ; don't prompt for the user input because that will confuse the automated grader.
- Do the above step repeatedly until the user enters a -1. You'll need to save some additional information as the user enters each number, but one of your important jobs on the assignment is figuring out what that information is, so I'm not telling it to you.
- Be sure you only save the information you decided on for positive integers
- When the user has finished entering data, print the count of the numbers you processed (not including -1) and mean of the numbers you processed (not including the -1) to 2 decimal places. If the user entered -1 as their first number or never entered any positive numbers, print NO INPUT instead.

### Required Output Format

Your single line of output should be the count of the numbers you processed, followed by a space, followed by the mean of the numbers you processed to 2 decimal places. The image below shows my output when I enter 1, 2, 3, 4, -4, -1; make sure you get the exact same output when you provide the same inputs.

### Submitting Your Solution

- Click on the gray box below that says Load Programming Assignment 2: When Will They Stop? in a new window. **(only in Canvas)**
- Click on the link for this graded assignment from the list of Live Coursework and click the green Submit button under Actions on the left on the assignment page. Upload your main.c file by clicking the Choose File button and navigating to it or by dragging that file onto the upload box. Click the green Submit button on the bottom right of the dialog box.
- Once the test case(s) for the assignment have been run (which typically happens pretty quickly), you can check your results for each test case and your overall score at the top right of the Test Cases section. If you’re happy with your results, you’re done.

If you need (or want) to improve your score, you can look at the test case results, modify your code as appropriate, and resubmit again. If you click on a specific test case, you can get additional information about the output generated by your submission, the expected output for a correct submission, and the difference between the two outputs (in the Pretty Diff section at the bottom of the dialog box).

*All assignments in the course are set for unlimited submissions, so you can resubmit as many times as you want until the due date/time. The grade you’ll receive for the assignment will be the highest grade you achieved across all your submissions for the assignment.*
