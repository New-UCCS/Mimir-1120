# Quick Tips to get you started on the C Language
### Easy C Arguments
##### If you're here, then you're a little confused on what the fancy stuff I put into my code is.
----
- ```'\n'``` = This indicated a new line to be printed. The backslash tells the compiler that "hey there's a command here" and then it reads what command letter is afterwards!
- ```&``` = This will be covered later into the class, but in simple terms this is the address of the variable in your computer! If you're using it to assign a ```scanf``` function to variable, think of the ```&``` as the address in which the mail(```scanf```) is being sent to!
- ```!=``` = This is a simple way of adding if ```varible 1``` is ___not equal___ to ```variable 2``` then return 1/Continue
- ```==``` = This a simple way of adding if ```variable 1``` ___is equal___ to ```variable 2``` then return1/Continue
- ```#include <stdio.h>``` = Stdio.h is the Standard Input/Output Library. So this just means that it makes me able to use printf and scanf accordingly through my code! 
- ```#include``` = Include just imports a library into our code that has been pre-coded or that is sent with Windows. There are tons of modules and libraries that you can use!
