# Assignment Description

Lectures: Iteration 2: For Loops and Iteration 3: Nested For Loops

Objective: Practice using for loops and nested for loops

### Getting Started

Create a new C project named whatever you want in Visual Studio using the Windows Desktop Wizard or in Xcode.

If you're using Visual Studio, add a main.c file to your project; you can use the main.c template I provided on Canvas if you’d like. If you’re using Xcode, Xcode automatically generates a main.c file for you.

### Requirements

#### Problem 1 - Print even numers in user-specified range

Read in an integer from the user; don't prompt for the user input, because that will confuse the automated grader.

Print all the even numbers from 0 up to that number (or 1 less than the maximum number if the number is odd).

#### Problem 2 - Print a row of asterisks that's a user-specified max width

Read in a row width from the user; don't prompt for the user input, because that will confuse the automated grader.

Print a single row asterisks that’s the user-specified row width.

For example, if the user enters 5 your program should output:

`*****`

#### Problem 3 - Print rows of asterisks that's a user-specified max width

Read in a row width and a number of rows from the user; don't prompt for the user input, because that will confuse the automated grader.

Print the appropriate number of rows of asterisks, with each row the user-specified row width.

For example, if the user enters 3 for the number of rows and 5 for the row width, your program should output:
```
*****
*****
*****
```
Hint: You need to use nested loops in your solution. The good news is that the for loop in your solution to the previous problem is your inner for loop for your solution to this problem.

The image below shows my output when I enter 10, 5, 7, and 6; make sure you get the exact same output when you provide the same inputs.

### Submitting Your Solution
- Click on the gray box below that says Load Graded Exercise 8: For Loops in a new window. **(only in Canvas)**
- Click on the link for this graded assignment from the list of Live Coursework and click the green Submit button under Actions on the left on the assignment page. Upload your main.c file by clicking the Choose File button and navigating to it or by dragging that file onto the upload box. Click the green Submit button on the bottom right of the dialog box.
- Once the test case(s) for the assignment have been run (which typically happens pretty quickly), you can check your results for each test case and your overall score at the top right of the Test Cases section. If you’re happy with your results, you’re done.

If you need (or want) to improve your score, you can look at the test case results, modify your code as appropriate, and resubmit again. If you click on a specific test case, you can get additional information about the output generated by your submission, the expected output for a correct submission, and the difference between the two outputs (in the Pretty Diff section at the bottom of the dialog box).

*All assignments in the course are set for unlimited submissions, so you can resubmit as many times as you want until the due date/time. The grade you’ll receive for the assignment will be the highest grade you achieved across all your submissions for the assignment.*
